# Working with Data Structures in PHP. Dijkstra’s Algorithm

#### We will talk about algorithms and data structures.

We will implement a singly linked list and then build a stack and a queue on top of it. Next, we will discuss the concept of a graph and create one using an adjacency matrix. Based on the classes we develop, we will implement breadth-first and depth-first graph traversal algorithms.

The highlight of our webinar will be a detailed explanation and implementation of **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a graph.
