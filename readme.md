# Working with Data Structures in PHP — Dijkstra’s Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to work with classic **data structures** and **graph algorithms** in PHP.

We start by implementing a **singly linked list**, and then build a **stack** and **queue** on top of it.  
Next, we explore the concept of **graphs**, constructing one using an adjacency matrix.  
Using these classes, we implement **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

The final goal of this project is a clear and practical implementation of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** — used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
